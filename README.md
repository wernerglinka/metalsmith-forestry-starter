  Metalsmith Forestry starter
</h1>

Based on the Metalsmith bare-bones starter. This starter is setup for content editing with the ForestryIO CMS. See the [demo site](https://metalsmith-forestry-starter.netlify.app/) here.

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Metalsmith site.**

    Clone the starter repository to create a new site.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-forestry-starter.git new-site 
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd new-site/
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

    Open the `new-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/content/index.md`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
