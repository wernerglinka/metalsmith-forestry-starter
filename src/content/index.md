# Metalsmith Forestry Starter

![](/assets/images/anvil-hammer-flame.jpg)

This Metalsmith starter website is based on the [Bare Bones Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter "Bare Bones Metalsmith Starter"). The difference is that this starter is setup with the Forestry IO Content Management System. Forestry is a JAMStack CMS that sit atop Github, allowing all content, including data json files, to be edited with a graphical UI.

Every edit in Forestry will be committed to [Github](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-forestry-starter) and this will trigger a site rebuild at Netlify.

A few pages have been implemented, you can add pages and folders in forestry directly in the dashboard.

Now go and let'er rip.
